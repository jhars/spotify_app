Requirements

Your app must have a form to search for tracks (songs). The form needs an input field for the search keyword.

When a user submits the form, use jQuery to get the search keyword from the form input.

Use AJAX to call Spotify's search endpoint with the search keyword from the form.

Use jQuery and Underscore templating to render the data you receive from Spotify in the view.

The data you render in the view should include the track name and artist name.

Each time the user submits the form, clear the previous search results from the view.
